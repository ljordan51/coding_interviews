CommonIterator:
Problem statement - Create a class, CommonIterator, which takes in two iterator objects. When the next() function is called on the CommonIterator it will return the next common element between the two input iterators. When the hasNext() function is called on the CommonIterator it will return a boolean value stating whether or not there is a next common element between the two iterators. The input iterators are assumed to be sorted in ascending value.

ThirdMax:
Problem statement - Create an algorithm which can find the third largest element in a non-empty integer array. The input array may be unsorted and contain duplicates.
